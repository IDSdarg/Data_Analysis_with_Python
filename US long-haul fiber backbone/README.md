<h1>United States Telecommunications Infrastructure Network Analysis</h1>
<h3>Infrastructure: Fiber optics, routers, base stations, conduits, etc</h3>


Background
====
Despite some 20 years of research efforts that have focused on understanding aspects of the Internetâ€™s infrastructure such as its router-level topology, very little is known about its individual components such as cell towers, routers or switches, and fiber-optic cables which are concrete entities with well-defined geographic locations.


Motivations
======
# All Telecos cannot build own conduit ... They share...  

[Project Slides Deck @GitHub &raquo;](http://richardafolabi.github.io/Presentation_js/US_Telecoms_Infrastructures.slides.html)


### Reasons for infrastructure sharing
1. Complexity - (huge planning, project management, etc)
2. Enormous Cost Overhead - (Labor, rentals, equipment, etc)
3. Environmental Impact - (Digging, road blocks, etc)


### >Project Objectives
>1. **`Evaluate state of current sharing model. What's known? What could it be better?`**

>2. **`Develop new (near) optimal sharing matrix`**

>3. **`Make recommendations (useful for Telecom and City planners)`**


### About Dataset
This data set provides a first-of-its-kind map of the US long haul fiber infrastructure. The details of the connectivity and shared use of conduits has been verified using public records on rights-of-way. The dataset is made available through PREDICT and includes the image of the map as well as a table that provides all details on connectivity represented in the map.

- ** 20 Service Providers ** *(Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Tata, CenturyLink, Cogent, etc)*
- ** 273 Nodes ** *(Routers, Switches, cell-towers/Base stations, fiber-optic cables, etc)*
- ** 542 Fiber nodes ** *(Edges connecting the nodes)*
